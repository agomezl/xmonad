-- $intro
--
-- The 'StackSet' data type encodes a window manager abstraction. The
-- window manager is a set of virtual workspaces. On each workspace is a
-- stack of windows. A given workspace is always current, and a given
-- window on each workspace has focus. The focused window on the current
-- workspace is the one which will take user input. It can be visualised
-- as follows:
--
-- > Workspace  { 0*}   { 1 }   { 2 }   { 3 }   { 4 }
-- >
-- > Windows    [1      []      [3*     [6*]    []
-- >            ,2*]            ,4
-- >                            ,5]
--
-- Note that workspaces are indexed from 0, windows are numbered
-- uniquely. A '*' indicates the window on each workspace that has
-- focus, and which workspace is current.

-- $zipper
--
-- We encode all the focus tracking directly in the data structure, with a 'zipper':
--
--    A Zipper is essentially an `updateable' and yet pure functional
--    cursor into a data structure. Zipper is also a delimited
--    continuation reified as a data structure.
--
--    The Zipper lets us replace an item deep in a complex data
--    structure, e.g., a tree or a term, without an  mutation.  The
--    resulting data structure will share as much of its components with
--    the old structure as possible.
--
--      Oleg Kiselyov, 27 Apr 2005, haskell\@, "Zipper as a delimited continuation"
--
-- We use the zipper to keep track of the focused workspace and the
-- focused window on each workspace, allowing us to have correct focus
-- by construction. We closely follow Huet's original implementation:
--
--      G. Huet, /Functional Pearl: The Zipper/,
--      1997, J. Functional Programming 75(5):549-554.
-- and:
--      R. Hinze and J. Jeuring, /Functional Pearl: The Web/.
--
-- and Conor McBride's zipper differentiation paper.

--      The Zipper, Haskell wikibook

-- $xinerama
-- Xinerama in X11 lets us view multiple virtual workspaces
-- simultaneously. While only one will ever be in focus (i.e. will
-- receive keyboard events), other workspaces may be passively
-- viewable.  We thus need to track which virtual workspaces are
-- associated (viewed) on which physical screens.  To keep track of
-- this, 'StackSet' keeps separate lists of visible but non-focused
-- workspaces, and non-visible workspaces.

-- $focus
--
-- Each stack tracks a focused item, and for tiling purposes also tracks
-- a 'master' position. The connection between 'master' and 'focus'
-- needs to be well defined, particularly in relation to 'insert' and
-- 'delete'.

-- A cursor into a non-empty list of workspaces.
--
-- We puncture the workspace list, producing a hole in the structure
-- used to track the currently focused workspace. The two other lists
-- that are produced are used to track those workspaces visible as
-- Xinerama screens, and those workspaces not visible anywhere.

-- A stack is a cursor onto a window list.
-- The data structure tracks focus by construction, and
-- the master window is by convention the top-most item.
-- Focus operations will not reorder the list that results from
-- flattening the cursor. The structure can be envisaged as:
--
-- >    +-- master:  < '7' >
-- > up |            [ '2' ]
-- >    +---------   [ '3' ]
-- > focus:          < '4' >
-- > dn +----------- [ '8' ]
--
-- A 'Stack' can be viewed as a list with a hole punched in it to make
-- the focused position. Under the zipper\/calculus view of such
-- structures, it is the differentiation of a [a], and integrating it
-- back has a natural implementation used in 'index'.
--
data Stack a = Stack { focus  :: !a        -- focused thing in this set
                     , up     :: [a]       -- clowns to the left
                     , down   :: [a] }     -- jokers to the right
    deriving (Show, Read, Eq)
